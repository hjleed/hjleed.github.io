Throughout my academic career, I have conducted multiple research contracts:
## Emotion recognition (Post-doctoral research)

My post-doctoral research focused on developing advanced emotion-recognition systems capable of analyzing human affective states using multimodal data. The project involved designing and implementing machine-learning models that integrate physiological signals, facial-expression analysis, and contextual information to improve the accuracy and robustness of automated emotion-detection frameworks. This work contributed to the broader field of affective computing by enhancing the interpretability of emotion-recognition algorithms and supporting applications in healthcare, human–computer interaction, and adaptive learning environments.

My doctoral research addressed the challenges of multi-class recognition in open-set sound classification and incremental model adaptation. The work proposed novel solutions to these problems and validated them through extensive experimental evaluation. Three peer-reviewed publications resulted from this research. The proposed methods demonstrated improved performance across a wide range of openness conditions in sound recognition tasks.

## Audio-Based Surveillance (research contract)

This project was conducted in two phases. The first involved algorithm development and evaluation in MATLAB, while the second produced a real-time C/C++ implementation integrated with iWatchLife’s platform. Both phases were validated using real-world camera recordings, with expanded testing in the second phase.

To improve system robustness, we implemented background–foreground audio separation, published in a conference paper with accompanying MATLAB code released on GitHub. The system successfully detected audio events in real data and operated in real time. Certain components were completed under confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with iWatchLife.

We conducted linear predictive coding (LPC), backward adaptation that aws advantage over the traditional forward adaptation of prediction coefficients. Specifically, backward adaptation eliminates the need to transmit prediction coefficients from the encoder to the decoder, thereby reducing the required bit rate. In addition, this method provided a very low computational complexity and minimal algorithmic delay, making it particularly suitable for real-time applications such as hearing aids.
In our proposed LPC framework employing backward adaptation, we evaluated performance at an overall data rate of 32 kbit/s for speech signals sampled at fₛ = 8 kHz. The results demonstrate  a perceptual quality improvement of approximately 0.2 in PESQ compared to the conventional forward-adaptation approach.



## Teaching a grade course SYS 5100 - Systems Engineering
( Winter 2025)<img src="https://www.zakirtechblog.com/post/matlab-optimization/featured.png" alt="Company Logo" width="50" style="vertical-align: middle;"> **Company Name**
I taught SYS 5100, a graduate-level course covering state-space modeling, controllability and observability, minimal realizations, state and output feedback, pole-placement methods, observer design, the separation principle, and compensator synthesis. The course also introduced optimal control concepts, including the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), algebraic Riccati equations, Kalman filtering, and fundamentals of nonlinear control with applications to fuzzy systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and chaotic dynamics.

In addition to the midterm examination, students completed three graded projects involving MATLAB-based fuzzy logic controllers and PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control. These projects demonstrated the use of PID controllers in practical domains such as temperature regulation, DC motor control, power factor correction, and voltage regulation. Students supported their simulations by reviewing published studies on PID applications in electromechanical systems, including automotive systems, thermal control, and dynamic mechanical processes. The course emphasized validating controller performance through MATLAB simulations, illustrating system stability, disturbance rejection, and real-time responsiveness.
