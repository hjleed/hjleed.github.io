Throughout my academic career, I have conducted multiple research projects and industry-supported contracts, summarized below.

## Emotion Recognition (Post-Doctoral Research)

My post-doctoral work focused on developing advanced emotion-recognition systems using multimodal data. The research involved designing machine-learning models that integrate physiological signals, facial-expression analysis, and contextual information to improve accuracy and robustness. This work contributed to affective computing, with applications in healthcare, human–computer interaction, and adaptive learning environments.

## Audio Recognition in Incremental Open-Set Environments (PhD Thesis)

My doctoral research examined the challenges of multi-class classification in open-set audio recognition and incremental model adaptation. I proposed and validated new algorithms through extensive experimentation, resulting in three peer-reviewed publications. The developed methods demonstrated improved performance across a wide range of openness conditions in sound-recognition scenarios.

## Audio-Based Surveillance (Research Contract)

This project proceeded in two phases:  
1. **Algorithm development** and evaluation in MATLAB.  
2. **Real-time implementation** in C/C++ integrated with iWatchLife’s surveillance platform.

To enhance system robustness, we introduced background–foreground audio separation, published as a conference paper with publicly released MATLAB code. The resulting system achieved real-time audio-event detection on real-world recordings. Portions of the work were completed under confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with iWatchLife.

## Linear Predictive Coding for Hearing Aids (Research Contract)

This project developed a linear predictive coding (LPC) framework using backward adaptation and noise shaping. Backward adaptation eliminates the need to transmit prediction coefficients, reducing bit rate while maintaining low computational complexity and minimal algorithmic delay—features essential for hearing-aid applications.  
At a data rate of 32 kbit/s and sampling frequency of 8 kHz, the proposed method achieved an improvement of approximately 0.2 PESQ compared to traditional forward-adaptation LPC techniques.

## Graduate Course Instruction: SYS 5100 – Systems Engineering
(Winter 2025) <img src="https://www.zakirtechblog.com/post/matlab-optimization/featured.png" alt="Company Logo" width="60" style="vertical-align: middle;"> **University of Ottawa**

I taught SYS 5100, a graduate-level course covering state-space modeling, controllability and observability, minimal realizations, state and output feedback, pole-placement, observer design, optimal control (LQR, Riccati equations), Kalman filtering, and introductory nonlinear control with applications to fuzzy systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and chaotic systems.

Students completed three graded MATLAB-based projects involving fuzzy-logic controllers and PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control. These projects explored PID applications in areas such as temperature regulation, DC motor control, power factor correction, and voltage regulation. Students supported their simulation work through reviews of published studies on PID control in various electromechanical systems, emphasizing performance validation through MATLAB simulations.

## Eukaryotic Gene Prediction (Master’s Research)

As part of my master’s studies, I conducted research on computational methods for eukaryotic gene prediction. The work focused on developing and evaluating algorithms capable of identifying coding regions within complex genomic sequences, where intron–exon structures present significant analytical challenges. My research involved applying statistical modeling, sequence analysis, and machine-learning techniques to improve the accuracy of gene-structure prediction in eukaryotic organisms. This project strengthened my foundation in bioinformatics and contributed to a deeper understanding of computational genomics and biological signal processing.
